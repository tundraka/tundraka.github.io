#What's a project
- A temporary 1 time undertaking
- has a defined goal
- has interrelated and dependent activities
- is finite in duration
- provides a unique product, services or information
 - Different stakeholders
 - Different requirements
- Operated under scope, quality, cost and time constraints

##Projects and ongoing work (processes)
Process improvement is in charge of taking care of the day to day processes,
for example, an utility company sends bills every month and provide a way for
the client to pay; they also provide the service for the client to have
electricity, etc.

Process improvement has nothing to do with project management

Projects have constraints
- Scope: How big is this projects? What does it include?
- Quality: How good is this thing?
- Cost: Once it's figured out how big/good. To do that it'll cost this much
  money and... 
- Time targets: will take this much time.

```
         ^
        / \
       /   \
Cost  /     \ Time
     /       \
    /_________\
   Scope, Quality
```

Changes to any of this elements will have an impact on the other 2. A change in
scope will need to be reviewed to determine what will be the impact on cost and
time. *You cannot change one constraint without adjusting another one*.

The Project Management Institute is the governing body for project management
world wide. They recently published that aside from the constraints listed
above, there will be 2 more which are: *Risk and Resources*. The diagram,
instead of being a triangle it now looks like a hexagon.

If we look at risk and resources, they really are a subset of the cost and time
piece.

##Scope
There are 3 ways to talk about scope. Normally we talk about the product scope,
how does it looks like when done. This is the product scope. The 3 parts of the
scope are:
- Product scope: All the things that will be created or delivered.
- Project scope: All the work that will be done during the projects
- Total scope: All the things and all the work

Quite often people talk about the product scope not realizing there's a whole
lot of work that has to happen to make those things actually come to fruition.

Official definition of project, from the project management institute, out of
the book called: A guide to the project management body of knowledge.
A temporary endeavor undertaking, undertaken to create a unique product,
service or result.

Project manager?
*Technical knowledge*: Not the subject matter expert on every element of the
project. If you're the subject matter expect of every part of the project you're
managing a very small projects. Do we really need a team?

Having a technical expertise it to have a knowledge base that allows you to
understand the language that the people around this project team table are going
to be using. And understand the way that this group thinks about the process to
get from the beginning to the end of the projects.

For example having a person from elementary education leading a group of brain
surgeons won't work very well. There will be a lot of terms that the brain surgeons
that the person of elementary education won't know about.

*Project management process skill*: What does it look like to manage a project
from beginning to end?

*Leadership skills*: You'll be working with a project team, stakeholders all
people that surrounds this project, you have to be able to work with people,
leading the project from beginning to end. The leadership part is a key piece
for successful projects.

Various roles of the PM
- **Task and human**. Have to work with the tasks and people on the project.
- **Integrator vs Technical expert**: have the right people available and draw
  expertise from them, so all the subject matter expertise is around the table.
 - With all that expertise is the job of the project manager to integrate that
   into the overall total project.
- **Big picture and detail**: PM has to look at all the details and the big
  picture, a process of going one from the other is needed.
 - Planning starts with the project down to the fine details. Doing the project
   starts with the details back up to the finally ended up product.
- **Politics**: Things to deal with with all the stakeholders around the
  project
- **Project vs Function**: Pull people from different areas, taking them out
  from their normal day to day function to work together.

**Project Manager**: The person assigned by the performing organization to achieve
the project objectives.

> **Project Management**: The application of knowledge, skills, tools and

**Process Groups**: The PMI defines 5 process groups for completing a project:
- Initiate: Start the project. Done looks like this.
- Plan: Plan how we're actually doing it.
- Execute: Do it
- Monitor and Control: Keeping things on target with the process and
