#Variance
Population mean, where the distribution is center at. How fat or thin, or
rather how spread out or how concentrated the density is around the mean is the
*variance*

The variance of a random variable is a measure of spread. If `X` is a random
variable that has mean `µ`, the variance is exactly the expected square
distance the random variable is from the mean. There's also a short version,
the expected value of `X` squared minus the expected value of `X` quantity
squared.

```
Vax(X) = E[(X-µ)^2] = E[X^2] - E[X]^2
```

Densities with higher variance are more spread out than densities with lower
variance and the square root of the variance is called the *standard
deviation*. The variance is expressed in the unit squared, while the std dev is
expressed as the same units as `X`.

In the example of tossing a die we have

```
E[X] = 3.5
# the formula to get the expected value of X^2
E[X^2] = 1^2 * 1/6 + 2^2 * 1/6 + ... + 6^2 * 1/6
E[X^2] = 15.17
Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 ≈ 2.92
```

What's the variance from the result of the toss of a coin with probability of
heads (1) of `p`?

The population variance associated with the distribution given by the flip of
a coin a biased coin is exactly `p(1-p)`

```
E[X] = 0 * (1 - p) + 1 * p = p
E[X^2] = E[X] = p
Var(X) = E[X^2] - E[X]^2 = p - p^2 = p(1-p)
```

population densities as the variance changes.

Just like the population mean and the sample mean were directly analogous, the
population variance and the sample variance are directly analogous. The
population mean was the center of mass of the population. The sample mean was
the center of mass of the observed data. The population variance is the
expected square of distance of a random variable from the population around the
population mean.

The sample variance is the average square of distance of the observed
observations minus the sample mean.

```
X^_ = sample mean. This is expressed as a capitol X with a underscore on top of
it.
S^2 = ∑_(i-1)(X_i - X^_)^2 / (n-1)
```

The variance of a sample variance. The sample variance is exactly a function of
the data. So, it's also a random variable, thus it also has a population
distribution. That distribution has a expected value and that expected value is
the population variance that the sample variance is trying to estimate. As we
collect more and more data, the distribution of the sample variance is going to
get more concentrated around the population variance it's trying to estimate.
The square root of the sample variance is the sample.
