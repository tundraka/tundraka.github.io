#R coding standards
1. Use text files.
2. Indent your code.
3. Limit the width of your code
4. Limit the length of individual functions

#Markdown
I've been taking notes using mark down :-)

- New lines: require a double space after the end of a line

```
First line
Second line
#output
First line Second line
```

Notice that there are 2 spaces after the end of 'First line'

```
First line  
Second line
#Output
First line
Second line
```

#R markdown
- Allows to create documents containing "live" R code
- Has the .rmd extension
- R code is evaluated as part of the processing of the markdown
- Results from R code are inserted into markdown document
- A code tool in **literate statistical programming**

- R markdown can be converted to standard markdown using the **knitr** package
  in R
- Markdown can be converted to HTML using the **markdown** package in R
- Any text editor can be used to create a markdown document; no special editing
  tools needed
- The R markdown -> mardown -> HTML work flow can be easily managed using
  R studio (but not required)
- Slides can be created using the **slidify** package.

#knitr
Literate statistcial programing
- Original idea comes from Don Knuth
- An article is a strean of text and code.
- Analysis code is divided into text and code 'chunks'
- Presentation code formats results (tables, figures, etc)
- Article text explains what is going on
- Literate programs are **weaved** to produce human-readable documents and
  **tangled** to produce machine readable documents.

Literate programming is a general concept. We need
- A documentation language
- A programming language

**Sweave** by Friedich Leisch used LaTeX and R, **knitr** supports a variety of
documentation languages.

####How do I make my work reproducible?
- Decide to do it (ideally from the start)
- Keep track of things, perhaps with a version control system to track
  snapshots/changes
- Use software whose operation can be coded
- Don't save output
- Save data in non-propietary formats.

####Literate programmin: pros
- Text and code all in one place, logical order
- Data, results automatically updated to reflect external changes
- Code is live--automatic "regression test" when building a document.

####Literate programmin: cons
- Text and code all in one place; can make documents difficult to read,
  especially if there is a lot of code.
- Can substatially slow down processing of documents (although there are tools
  to help)
