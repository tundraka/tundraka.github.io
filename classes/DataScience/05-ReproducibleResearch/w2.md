#R coding standards
1. Use text files.
2. Indent your code.
3. Limit the width of your code
4. Limit the length of individual functions

#Markdown
I've been taking notes using mark down :-)

- New lines: require a double space after the end of a line

```
First line
Second line
#output
First line Second line
```

Notice that there are 2 spaces after the end of 'First line'

```
First line  
Second line
#Output
First line
Second line
```

#R markdown
- Allows to create documents containing "live" R code
- Has the .rmd extension
- R code is evaluated as part of the processing of the markdown
- Results from R code are inserted into markdown document
- A code tool in **literate statistical programming**

- R markdown can be converted to standard markdown using the **knitr** package
  in R
- Markdown can be converted to HTML using the **markdown** package in R
- Any text editor can be used to create a markdown document; no special editing
  tools needed
- The R markdown -> mardown -> HTML work flow can be easily managed using
  R studio (but not required)
- Slides can be created using the **slidify** package.
