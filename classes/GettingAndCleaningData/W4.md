#Editing Texts Variables.
- `tolower`
- `toupper`
- `strsplit(x, '\\.')`: Splits `x` on the character `\\.`
```R
> strsplit(vaersdata[1, RECVDATE], '/')
[[1]]
[1] "01"   "01"   "2014"
```

- `sub`: Substitute characters once.
- `gsub`: Substitutes characters all.
```R
tex <- 'this_is_my_test'
sub('_', '', tex) # thisis_my_test
gsub('_', '', tex) # thisismytest
```

- `grep`: returns the vector position where the search string matches.
- `grepl`: grep(l)ogical, returns T or F based on the presence of the search.
```R
tex <- 'This is a good test'
grep('s', tex) # 1 because there's only 1 value/vector.
grep('s', tex, value=T) # 'This is a good test' since that's the string that
                        # matched
grepl('s', tex) # T
length(grep('z', tex)) # 0
```

####library(stringr)
- `nchar(x)`: amount of chars in a `x`
- `substr(x, start, end)`: Extracts part of `x`, based on `start`/`end`
- `paste`, `paste0(x, y)`: concatenates `x` and `y`, `paste0` no space in
  between
- `str_trim`: removes spaces around the string.

##Important points about text in data sets
- Variable names should:
 - All lower cases
 - Descriptive
 - Not duplicate
 - No underscores/dots/white spaces
- Variables with chars class
 - Try to make them factors (depends on the application)
 - Values should be descriptive, TRUE/FALSE instead of 0/1, Male/Female instead
   of (M/F))

#Regular expressions.
Allows search for a text that might fit a more broad pattern. So, it's not
about searching for specific strings, but rather, patterns in the strings.
- Metacharacters: Gramar of the language.
- Literals: words of the language

- `[Bb][Uu][Ss][Hh]` matches: Bush, bush, BUSh, etc.
- `^[0-9][a-zA-A]`, starting with eiher aA, Aa, 0a, etc.
- `[^?.]$` Not finishing with either ? or .
