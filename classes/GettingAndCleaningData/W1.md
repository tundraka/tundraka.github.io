#Obtaining Data - Motivation
*Raw data -> Processing script -> tidy data* -> data analysis -> data
communication
##Raw and processed data
*Data*: Data are values of qualitative or quantitative variables, belonging to
a *set of items*.

- Set of items: sometimes called the population; the set of objects you are
  interested in.
- Variables: A measurement or characteristic of an item.
- Qualitative: Country of origin, sex, treatment
- Quantitative:  Height, weight, blood pressure.

Raw data
- The origin a source of the data
- Often hard to use for data analyses
- Data analysis *includes* processing
- Raw data may only need to be processed once: Keep a record of all the steps
  performed.

Process data (ready for analysis):
- Data ready for analysis
- Processing can include merging, subsetting, transforming, etc.
- There may be standards for processing
- All steps should be recorded.

##Components of tidy data
Four things you should have:
1. The raw data
2. A tidy data set
3. A code book describing each variable and its values in the tidy data set.
   The metadata.
4. An explicit and exact recipe you used to go from 1 to 2, 3

You know the raw data is in the right format if you:
1. Ran no software on the data
2. Did not manipulate any of the numbers in the data
3. You didn't remove any data from the data set
4. You didn't summarize the data in any way.

The tidy data
1. Each variable you easure should be in one column
2. Each different observation of that variable should be in a different row
3. There should be one table for each "kind" of variable
4. If you have multiple tables, they should include a column in the table that
   allows them to be linked.

Other
- name of variables in the top of the file
- Variables should be human readable
- one file per table.

The code book
- Info about variables, units, etc.
- Summary choices, are we using mean, median, etc.
- Information about the experimental study you used.

Other
- Common format, md.
- "Study design" section that describes how the data was collected
- "Code book" section, to describe variables and units.

The instruction list
- Ideally a script in R (or any other script language)
- Input for the script is the raw data
- The output is tidy data
- No params to the script.

If a script if not possible we need to specify what steps will need to be taken
by the user. What software/version/params were used to run, what were the other
steps, etc. The more detail, the better.
