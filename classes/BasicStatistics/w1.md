Variables: Characteristics of something.
Cases: Characteristics of someone.

Features of individual soccer players: height, weight, hair color, etc. Variables
Feature of a specifc player: Case.

A variable has one only requirement, it needs to change.
The soccer teams from spain have one variable, the city they're from. The teams
have one constant, the country they are part of.
A variable can have different levels of measurements.
# Nominal
The most simple level of measurements is a nominal variable.
A nominal variable is made up of varios categories that differ from each other
There's no order, is not possible to argue that one category is better or more
or worse or less than another.
An example would be the nationality of a soccer player, the different values,
French Mexican, Spanish differ, but there's no ranking.
Another example, the gender (although soccer duh, all male, but not better than
female)

# Ordinal
- There's a difference between values
- There is also order

Example:
- The order in a football competitions, who's 1st, 2nd, etc.
- You
