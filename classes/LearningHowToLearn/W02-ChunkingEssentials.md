#Introduction to chunking
Themes of this week:
- Chunking
 - Compact packages of information that we can easily access.
- Illusion of competence in learning
 - Fool ourselves that we are learning.
- Overlearning
 - Interleaving: variaty in topics.
##What's a chunk
- Link bits of information through meaning or use.
 - A network of neurons that are used to fire in together.
 - Focus, practice and repetition (creation of strong memory traces) help create chunks.
 - Small chunks can become larger (practice)
 - Practice and rep in building chunk are all you need to become a truly creative
   master of the material we're learning.
 - Chunks help the brain runs efficiently, we got the main idea.
- The new logical whole makes the chunk easy to remember and fit into the
  larger picture of what we're learning.
- Facts without understanding or context is not helpful there's no way to tie
  them together to other bits of information.

##How to form a chunk

###Part 1
- Best chunk are those that we don't need to conscuiouly think about connecting
  the neuro path together.
- Neural representation of something new can be too big
- We start by diving parts and then link together to create bigger chunks.
- Heavy cognitive load, walk through example. Why the steps are taken the way
  they are.
 - 1 concern: ALl too easy to focus on why in idivivdual steps and not on the
   connection of the steps.
 - More like a road map to take you to a place. Pay attention to the
   surrounding as opposed to blindly following the steps.

### Part 2
Chunking in different areas is different, history, karate, etc are completely
different. We'll focus on chunking of mental ideas, rather than physical movements.

#### Focus your undividis attention on what you want to learn.
Learning something implies creating new neural patterns and connection with other
in different areas in the brain. We cannot reach to certain areas if we are
distracted while trying to learn.

#### Understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk.
- Can you create a chunk without understanding? Yes, but it won't relate to
  other material.
- just understanding how a problem was solved doesn't necessarily created
  a chunk that you can easily recall later.
- Dont confuse an a-ha with solid expertise.
- We will need to review it.
- Understanding something is when you can actually do it by your self, closing
  the book and trying again is  a good exercise to test if we really
  understood. 
- Understanding it, doesn't mean that you can actually do it. Only doing it
  yourself helps create the patterns that underline true mastery.

**Note**: This is a confusing section. On one hand we have:
- 3:18 - Understanding something is when you can actually do it yourself
- 3:49 - Understanding something, doesn't mean you can actually doit.

#### Gaining context, not only how but when to use this chunk.
- Going beyond the initial problem
- repeating and practicing with both related and unrelated problems
- practice helps you broaden the networks of neurons that are connected to the
  chunk, ensuring it's not only firm, but also accessible from many different
  paths
- Learning takes place in two ways
 - bottom up: practice and repetition can help you build and strengthen each
   chunk
 - top down: big picture process, what you're learning and where it fits in.
 - Both processes are important in gaining mastery over what we're learning.
- Context is where bottom up and top down learning meet. WHen to use a techique
  as opposed to other
- A *picture walk* (looking at picture, section headings, can help get a big
  picture of the material
 - Helps to see where to put the chunks that you're learning. How they related
   to each other
 - Leanr the major concepts or points first. Once that's clear fill in the
   details. Even though you'll miss some details, you can still see the big
   picture.

####Chunks are best build with
- Focused attention
- Understanding (of the main idea)
- Practice

#Illusions of competence
- The imporatnce of recall
- Illusions of competence
- Mini-testing
- The value of making mistakes

###Recall
*Recall* is an exercise to help learn material from a book, it's more productive
that re-reading, and concept maps. Look away from the material and see what you can
recall.

The retrieval process enhances deep learning and helps up to begin forming
chunks.

Building connection between chunks before the basic chunks are embeded in the
brain doesn't work that well; like trying to lear advance strategy in chess
without learning how the pieces move.

The only time where re-reading is better is when you space re-reading, more
along the lines of spaced repetition.

When you're first trying to learn how to understand a concept or techinque, you
entire working memory is involved in the process all tangled. As we begin to
chun the concept, we feel like connections are smooth in your mind. Once it's
chunked, it takes one slot in working memory, it becomes one strand that is
easy to follow and to make new connections, the rest of the working memory
remains free. In this way, it increases the amount of information available to
your working memory, like a link to a place where greater knowledge is stored.

###Illusions of competence
Once of the most common *illusions of competence* is glancing at a solution and
thinking that you understand the material. We must have the information
persisting in our memory to master the material well enough to do well in test and
to think creatively with it.

Highlighting and underlinding, can be innefective and missleading, making
movement with your hand might fool you into thinking that you've places the
concept in your brain. Try to look for main ideas and try to keep underlining
and highlighting to a minimum.

On the other hand side notes on a margin that synthesize ideas is a good idea.
Looks like when we open a book it gives the illusion that the information is in
our brain. Because it can be easier to look into the book instead of recalling
we remainin our illusion that we have the knowledge. Having the material and
spending a lot of time with it doesn't guarantee that we learn it.

***Testing*** is a way to make sure that we learnt the material. Recall is
actually doing the same. Allowing you to see if you really grasp an idea.
***Mistakes in testing*** helps you detect flaws in your thinking and to correct it.

Recalling material when you're out of your outside of you usual place of
studing. When you're learning something new, you can take subliminal cues from
the space surrounding you at the moment when learning. Recalling and rethinking
when outside of our usual env, you become independent of the cues of the place
where you learn the material.

#What motivates you
Most of the neurons in our cortex carry information about what's happening
around and what we're doing. There's also a diffusely projecting system of
neuromodulators that carry information not about the content of an experience
but its importance and value to your future.

Neuromodulators are chemicals that influence how neurons respond to other neurons.
They have a profound impact on your unconscious mind.
- Acetylcholine
- Dopamine
- Serotonin

##Acetylcholine
- Created by acetylcholine neurons 
- Important for focused learning.
- Project widely and activate circuits that control synaptic plasticity.
  Leading to new long term memory

##Dopamine
- Motivation is controlled by dopamine
- Is release from the neuron when we receive an unexpected reward.
- Found in a small set of neurons in our brain stem
- Predicting future rewards and not only the immediate reward.
- Help motivates to do something that may not be rewarding right now but will
  be in the future.
- Have a very powerful effect on learning, also affects decision making.
- Part of a large brain system that control reward learning
- Located in the basal ganglia above the dopamine neurons and below the cortex of
  the brain
- Artificial drugs artificially increase dopamine activity, fool the brain into
  thinking that something wonderful has just happened.
 - Leads to craving and dependence which can hijack your free will and motivate
   action that are harmful to ourself.
- Loss of dopamine neurons leads to lack of motivation, and something called
  anhedonia.
 - anhedonia. is the loss of interest in things that once gave you pleasure.
- Severe loss of dopamine neurons cuases resting tremor, slowness, rigiditiy
  (Parkinson disease). Lead to catatonia.
- Part of the unconsious part of the brain.

##Serotonin
- Strongly affects your social life
 - In monkey groups the alpha male has the higher levels of serotonin
 - The omega has the lowest levels of serotonin
- Prozac raises the levels of serotonin
- Serotonin is like to risk taking, less serotonine greater risk taking.
- Inmates in jail for violent crimes have some of the lowest levels of
  serotonin in society

##Emotions
- Strongly affect learning.
- Emotions were once thought to be separate from cognition
- Emotions are intertwined with perception and attention and interact with
  learning and memory.
- The amigdala in one of the major center where cognition and emotion are
  effectively integrated.
 - Part of the lymbic system.
 - Together with hippocampus is involved in processing memory and decision making as
   well as regulating emotional reactions.
 - Happy amigdala, happy learner.
- The emotions and your neuromodulatory systems are slower than perception and
  action, but are no less importan for successful learning.

#The value of a library of chunks
- Compaction
- Transfer
- Creativity
- Law of serendipity

##Compaction, transfer
- To enhance their knowledge and epertise is to gradually build the number of
  chunks in their mind. Valuable bits of information that we can link in new
and creative ways.
- *Transfer* chunk concepts that you learn in physics can be very similar to
  chunk concepts in business
- Chunk: compress information. Compavtion.
- As we gain more experience in chunking, we'll be able to create bigger
  chunks, in some sense the neural patterns are longer and solid.
- We can skip to the right solution while in diffuse mode. Two or more chunks
  can be connected while in diffuse mode.
- As we build chunks fills a part of the larger picture, without practice
  chunks can fade making it difficult to see the big picture.

##Creativity
Two ways of figuring something out
- sequential step by step reasoning
 - Each small step leads to the solution, involves the focused mode.
- holistic: intuition, creative diffuse mode linking of several seamingly
  different focus mode thoughts. Most difficult problems and concepts are
grasps through intuition because these new ideas make a leap away from what
you're familiar with.
- The diffuse mode, semi-random way of making connection, should be carefully
  verified using the focus mode, intuitive insights are not always corect

##Law of serendipity
It could be the case that there are many problems or concepts or in whatever
chapter/section you're studying.

*Law of serendipity*: Lady Luck favors the one who tries.

Focus on whatever section, once that problem is in our mental library, the 2nd
would go easier and the 3rd even more.

#Overlearning, choking, einstellung and iterleaving
- When learning something, we tend to practice over and over again on the same
  study session
- *Overlearning* is when you continue to practice something that you already
  master.
- Help increase automaticity. Can be helpful in times of nervousness, for
  example practicing for a talk.
- Can be a waste of valuable learning time.
- Once we master something, continuing to practice on the same session doesn't
  increase long term memory retention.
- Focusing on one technique is like learning carpentry by only practicing with
  a hammer, it may be the case that we want to do everything with a hammer.
- Promotes illusion of competence, practicing something that we already master
  is easy. We only mastered the easy stuff.

##Deliverate practice
- We want to balance our studies by deliveratively focusing on what we found
  more difficult. This is *deliverate practice*.

##Einstellung
- We can translate Einstellung as mindset.
- Your initial thought may prevent a better idea or solution to be found.
- your initial intuition about what's happening or what you need to be doing is
  missleading.
- We need to unlearn our erroneous older ideas when learning new ones.
- Blovked thought due to their preceding trainig.

##Interleaving
- Sometime we want to jump into the water without learning to swim.
- We blindly start working on homework before reading the material, attending
  lecture, etc.
- Like start solving a problem without thinking where the solution really lies.
- UNderstanding how to attain real solution is important in lifes.
- Once we have chunks we need to know how to select and use different chunks
- *Interleaving*: Jumping back and forth between problems or situation that
  require different techniques or strategies.
- Once the basic idea of a technique, start interleaving the practice with
  problems of different types, approaches, concepts or procedures.
- In science and math, it helps to look ahead of problems that are in the end
  of the chapter.
- You want your brain to get used to the idea that just knowing how to use
  a concept/approach isn't enought we also need to use when to use it.
- Starts building flexibilty and creative, where we leave the world or practice
  and repetition and begin thinking more independently.
- If you develop expertise in only one topic, you may know if very deeply but
  you make become more deeply entrenched and not able to handle new ideas.

#Optional interviews

##Norman Fortenberry - Learning at MIT
- In engineering you're part of a team
- Make sure that you find a team and the team members are serious about their
  studies.
- Just by joining a top level institution, you didn't become less smart. Need
  to build a community of support.

## Scott Young - a "Marco Polo" of Learning
- About self explanation.
 - Once a topic has been studied, write about it as if you were explaining it.
 - You'll normally find that there are point where there's some "friction", too
   vague, not very precisse, that indicates points where you've missed and need
to be reviewed.
- Richard Feynman's : the first rule is not to fool yourself, but you're the
  easiest person to fool.
- Always have a mission.
- Explore MIT open courseware

## Amy Alkon
- Again, writing things as a way to engrain things in your brain.
