#Introduction to chunking
Themes of this week:
- Chunking
 - Compact packages of information that we can easily access.
- Illusion of competence in learning
 - Fool ourselves that we are learning.
- Overlearning
 - Interleaving: variaty in topics.
##What's a chunk
- Link bits of information through meaning or use.
 - A network of neurons that are used to fire in together.
 - Focus, practice and repetition (creation of strong memory traces) help create chunks.
 - Small chunks can become larger (practice)
 - Practice and rep in building chunk are all you need to become a truly creative
   master of the material we're learning.
 - Chunks help the brain runs efficiently, we got the main idea.
- The new logical whole makes the chunk easy to remember and fit into the
  larger picture of what we're learning.
- Facts without understanding or context is not helpful there's no way to tie
  them together to other bits of information.

##How to form a chunk
###Part 1
- Best chunk are those that we don't need to conscuiouly think about connecting
  the neuro path together.
- Neural representation of something new can be too big
- We start by diving parts and then link together to create bigger chunks.
- Heavy cognitive load, walk through example. Why the steps are taken the way
  they are.
 - 1 concern: ALl too easy to focus on why in idivivdual steps and not on the
   connection of the steps.
 - More like a road map to take you to a place. Pay attention to the
   surrounding as opposed to blindly following the steps.
### Part 2
- Chunkin in different areas is different, history, karate, etc are completely
  different. We'll focus on chunking of mental ideas, rather than physical
movements
1. Focus your undividis attention on what you want to learn.
2. Learning something implies creating new neural patterns and connection with
   other in different areas in the brain. We cannot reach to certain areas if
we are distracted while trying to learn.
2. Understand the basic idea you're trying to chunk.
3. Can you create a chunk without understanding? Yes, but it won't relate to
   other material.
 - just understanding how a problem was solved doesn't necessarily created
   a chunk that you can easily recall later.
 - Dont confuse an a-ha with solid expertise.
 - We will need to review it.
 - Understanding something is when you can actually do it by your self, closing
   the book and trying again is  a good exercise to test if we really
understood.
