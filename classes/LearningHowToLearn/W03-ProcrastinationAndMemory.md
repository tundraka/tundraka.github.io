#Procrastination and Memory

##Introduction to Procrastination and Memory
Building solid chunks in long term memory, easily accessible by work memory
takes time.

##Procrastination

###Tackling Procrastination
- Good learning is a bit by bit activity
- Will power uses a lot of neural resources
- Shouldn't use will power on fending off procrastination except when
  absolutely necessary
- Procrastination can be an important keystone bad habit
 - A habit that influences many importan areas of your life
 - Improvining abilities in fighting procrastination, other positive changes
   will gradually begin to unfold
- Procrastination share features with addiction
 - offers temporary excitement and relief
 - It can fool you into thinking that it'd be better to browse for information
   in the web as opposed to take the reading material or doing assignments
 - You can start telling yourself stories
 - Devise irrational excuses that sound reasonable, for example: If I study to
   far ahead of the test I'll forget the material

###Zombies Everywhere
- Before chunking, we would be spending a lot of resources, for example, when
  driving a bike for the first time, we would be paying a lot of attention so
we don't fall off the bike.
- Once we are use to ride the bike, once we have chunked it, this would be
  an easy activity that may become automatic (zombie mode).
- Chunking is related to habit, habit is an energy saver, allow us to free our
  mind for other types of activities
We can think of habits havin four parts
1. the cue - the trigger that launches you into zombie mode, for example:
 - seeing the first item in your todo list.
 - seeing a text message from
 The cue by itself is neither good or bad, it's the routine; what we do in
 reaction to that cue is what matters
2. The routine, the zombie mode, the routine habitual response that it falls
   into once the cue is received. The response can be useful, harmless, or
harmful.
3. The reward. Every habit develops and continues because it reward us, it
   gives us an immediate feeling of pleasure. Procrastination is so easily to
develop, because moving your mind into something more pleasant happens so
quickly and easily.
 Good habits can also be rewarded. Finding ways to reward good habits is
important for escaping procrastination
4. The belief. Habits have power because of your belief in them. To change your
   habit you'll need to change your underlying belief

###Process vs Product
- It's ok to have negative feeling when starting a study session, even
  a subject that I like, it's how we handle those feelings that matter.
- Reserach has found that non procrastinators put their negative feelings
  aside: quit wasting time  -- you'll feel better soon
- Facing the situation when not doing something because it makes us feel
  unfomfortable can be overcome by reframing things, focus on *process* not
*product*.
 - Not making a brick wall but a brick
- **Process**: the flow of time and the habits and actions associated with that
  flow of time
- **Product**: An outcome, for example an assignment.

To prevent procrastination you want to avoid concentrating on the product,
instead the attention should be on building processes. Processes relate to
simple habits, habits that allow you to do the unpleasant task that needs to be
done.

The challenge is to avoid focusing on the product. The product is what triggers
the pain that causes you to procrastinate. Instead we need to focus on the
process or processes, the small chunks of time that you need over days or weeks
to complete the goal task. It's not about achieving the goal in one session,
it's about building a wall by focusing on making bricks every day.

Whenever a distraction arises, just let if flow by. Also, setting yourself to
reduce distraction is a good idea.

###Harnessing your zombies to help you
- We will want to overwrite part of out habits and develop a few new ones, as
  opposed to a complete change in them
- The trick to overwriting a habits is to look at change our reaction to a cue.
- Will power is used to change the reaction to the cue.

**The cue**: recognized what lanches you into the procrastination mode. Cues
  usually fall into one of the 4 categories.
 - location
 - time
 - how you feel
 - reaction either to other people or to something that just happened.
- The issue with procrastination is that because it's an automatic habit, your
  normally unaware that you're procrastinating.

**The routine**
- Instead of doing my studies I go to do something less painful.
- The brain wants to go into this routine when we got the cue.
 - This is when we need to actively rewiring the old habit.
- To develope a *plan* is the way to rewiring. Creating a new ritual can be
  helpful.

**The reward**
- May require a little bit of investigation.
 - Why am I procrastinating?
 - Can we substitute an emotion payoff, a sense of satisfaction, win a small
   internal bet about something you turned into?
- Habits are powerful because they *create neurological craving*
- Only once your brain starts expecting that reward will the importan rewiring
  take place that will allow you to create new habits.
- Sometimes having a reward at specific time, like having lunch with a friend,
  stoping work at 5pm, gives a solid mini deadline that can help spur work.
- The better you get a something the more enjoyable it can become.

**The belief**
The most important part of changing the procrastination habit is to belief that
you can do it. You may find out that when the going gets stressful, you long to
fall back inot old, more comfortable habits. What can get you go through is the
belief that the new system works.

##Memory
- 

###Juggling life and learning.
- A complex balance of different task
- Write a week list of key task in a journal
 - Each day on another page list the tasks that you can reasonably work on.
 - Write this *to-do* list the evening before.
 - Why the event before?
  - Research has shown that this helps your subconscious assimilate the tasks
    on the list so yuou can figure out how to accomplish them
 - If you don't write your task down they lurk at the edge of the four slots of
   your working memory taking some mental real state.
 - Include difuse mode tasks?
- Makes
