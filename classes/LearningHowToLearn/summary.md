## Two modes of thinking:
- Focused
- Diffuse 
- You can be in either but not in both.
- Metaphor and analogies are helpful when trying to learn something.
## Procrastination
- Everyone has issue with it.
- When experiencing areas of the brain associated with pain are activated.
- Pomodoro helps, it defines periods of complete focus followed by periods of
  relaxation.
## Practice makes permanent
- Abstract ideas are hard to understand (like those of math and science)
- Ideas that we perceive in the world are easy to associate.
- Feelings even though they aren't tangible, are linked to our emotions, which
  we can feel.
- Practice enhance and strengthen the neural connections made when learning
  abstract concepts.
- After focusing on something we need to let our brain to go into the diffuse
  mode and work in the background.
- **Analogy**: the mortar needs to dry before we can put more brick on it. In
  the same way
