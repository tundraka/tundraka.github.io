## Using the focused and Diffuse modes
Two modes of thinking
- Focused
 - Concentratin on something you try to learn or understand
Difuse thinking
 - Relaxing 
 - The neural resting states that underlie the diffuse mode seem to allow you
   to cast your thinking much more broadly

Metaphor and analogy helpful when trying to learn something new.
Focused mode
- Familiar
New ideas or approaches
- How to get to those pathsm when there are other paths in the way.
- You can look at things broadly, from a big picture perspective, new neural
  paths, 

We can either be in the focused mode or the difuse, like a coin, you can see
one side or the other, but not both. Being in one mode blocks your way to
access to the other mode.

Mind able to go back and forth between the 2 modes. It takes time.
Lifting strength by lifting weight. TO gain muscular structure, a little work
every day, In the same way, to buld beural structure a littl ework every day.

## What's learning.
- The heavy lifting is done in the subsconsious
- Synapsys, where memories are stored
- Brain connectivity is dynamic and remains so even after it matures
- New synapses being formed and other dissapearing.
- If so many changes happen how does memory remains stable over the years?
- Synapses are < than a micron in diameter, human hair 20microns
- You're not the same person after a nap.

## Procrastination.
- Everyone has issues with it.
- When we see something we don't want to do, we activate areas that related to
  pain. Our brain switch the attneiont to something else.
- Not long after starting working on that that we don't like the nreral
  dissordear disspaear.

When you procrastinate it goes like this.

1. Unhappy feling: You observe and get a cut aboutsomething that causes a tiny
   bit of uneasy
2. To make the sensation go away, you turn your attenion to something more
   pleasant.
3. You feel happy, temporarily

**Pomodoro**: Francesco Cirillo, early 1980.
- A timer to 25 min.
- Turn off all interruptions,
- focus, most everyone can focus for 25 min.
- A little reward comes after the 25 min.

#Practice makes permanent#
Why math, science are the hardes to understand. They think it might be related
tot he abstract nature of the ideas.

For things that we can see in our world, it's easy to associate an idea with
something tangible. On the other hand for mathematical ideas, there's often no
analogous thing that you can point to. No plus signs out in the field. They are
more abstract.

What about love, zest or hope? They are also abstract. These abstract terms are
often related to our emotions, we can feel our emotions even though we can't
see and point to concreate examples, like the cow example.

It's important to practice with ideas and concepts your learning in math and
science. Just like anything else to help enhance and strengthen the neural
connections that you're making during the learning process.

Neurons become linked through repeated use. The more abstract something is, the
more important it is to practice in order to bring those ideas into reality for
you. Even though the ideas you're dealing with are abstract, the neural
thought paterns that you're creating are real and concrete. At least they are,
if you build and strengthen them through practice.

**Analogy**: There's an analogy with thought patterns, initially when we first
understand a problem, the neural connections are faint, when we continue practice
the neural connection become stronger. After practice, we can go through each step
without looking at the original guide.

When you're learning, what you want is to focus hard intently on something.
Then take a brake, or at least change your focus to something different for
a while. During this time, your brain diffuse mode has a chance to work away in
the background and help you out with your conceptual understanding. Your
neiural mortar has a chance to dry. If you learn by cramming, your learning
would look like a grumble.

**Analogy**: When taking time to relax or focus on something different, we are
letting our neural mortar to solidify. If we continue to push thing into it
without solidifying, we will end up with a grumble. The analogy is a wall, the
mortar wit the neural path and the bricks the knowledge.

*Chunking*: the vital escence of how you grasp and master key ideas.

#Introduction to memory#
- Long term memory: when we remember things like word in another language,
  a formula, functions in a programming language.
- Working memory: Holding a few ideas to connect them together so I can
  uderstand a concept or solve a problem.

The brain moves things from long term to working memory.

**Working memory**: has to do with what you're immediately and consciously
processing in your mind. Centers in the Prefontral cortex, there are other connection
to other areas of the brain so we can access long term memory.

Initially it was thought that working memeory hold 7 items or chunks, the working
memory can only store 4 chunks.

We tend to automatically group memory items into chunks so it seems our working
memeory is bigger than it is. ALthough it seems to behave like a black board,
it's not a very good black board, we need to constantly repeat so it can stay
in your working memory. This is because natural disipating processes don't suck
those memory away.

**Analogy**: There's the picture of a vampire sucking a neuron, this are the
disipatting processes that take away the working memory.

Short term memory, an inefficient mental blackboard. The long term memory is
like a storage warehouse and like a warehouse it's distributed over a big area.
Different kind of long term memory are stored in different regions of the
brain. As mentioned before, if we want to put something into long term memory,
we will need to practice it for some time so we can increase the chances to
find it later. Inmense, so many items that they can bury themselves.
Something new is handled in our wokirn memory, to move it into lonf term memory
(LTM) it often takes time and practice.

To help with this, we can use the technique, *space repetition*, over a number
of days, extending the practice over several days does make a difference.
Research show that if you try to glue thing into your memory by repeating
something 20 times in one evening. It won't stay as well as if you practice it
a number of times over several days. Time to let the synoptic connections to
build and strengthen.

#Sleep in learning#
Being awake create toxic products in your brain. How does the brain gets rid of
this poisons. turns out that when you sleep, your brain cells shrink, this
increases the space between your brain cells. It's like unblocking a stream
fluid can pass these cells wash the toxins out and wash the toxins out.

**Analogy**: Taking a test without sleeping, inhibits your ability to think.
Like driving a car with sugar in its tank. Getting too little sleep, doesn't
make you do worse on tests, too little sleep over a long of a time can also be
associated with all sort of conditions: headaches, diabetes, depression, heart
disease and just plain dying earlier.

Sleep does more that washing toxins, important part of the memory and learning
process. During sleep you brain tidies up ideas and concepts you're thinking
about and learning. It erases less important parts of memories and at the same
time strengthen areas that you need or want to remember. While sleeping, your
brain also rehearses some of the tougher part of whatever you're trying to lean
going over and over neural patterns to deepen and strengthen them.

Sleep also associated with your ability to figure out and understand what
you're trying to learn, as if the complete deactivation of the conscious of the
prefrontal cortex at the forefront of the brain helps other areas of your brain
start taking to one another, allowing them to put together the neural solution
to your learning task while you're sleeping.

If you're going over what you're learning, right before you take a nap or going
to sleep for the evening, you have an increase chance to dream about it. If you
go even further and set it in mind that you want to dream about the material,
it seems to improve your changes of dreaming about it still further. Dreaming
about what you study, can substantially enhance your ability to understand.

- Learning by doing
- And learning by osmosis, by getting with other experts.
- Asking questions, leads to important discussions, difference between  active
  engagementy, passive listening.
- How to get into diffuse mode of thinking. Jogging, exercising, to get the
  mind disengaged. Important to take a notebook to write stuff/ideas.
- Multitask? You can't do two things at the same time. Back and forth context
  switching.
- All the cell that you have in your brain, you had at birth. After birth the
  wiring takes place and learning changes the connections between the neurons
  over the same old neurons that you had when you were born. Some die, there's
  shrinkage of your cortex.

It was discovered that in an important area of your
brain for learning and memory the Hippocampus, new neurons are being born even
in adulthood. It was discovered, if you have an animal in a rich environment,
and then look in the hippocampus, the strength of the connection between the
neurons is much stronger there, by a factor of two. Than a rat that has been
kept in a cage where there's impoviresh env.

Having an enriched environment even as an adult is going to help you, instead
of locking yourself, you want to be surrounded by other people who are
estimulating to you. events that are happening that you can actively
participate.

It was also discovered, in the absense of an enrich environment, exercise will also
increase the # of new neurons that are born and will survive.
Creative environment with other creators, 
Success doesn't necessarily come by being smart. People who is passionate and
persistence, success in life is that, passion and persistence, staying in the
course, not letting go, not giving up.
