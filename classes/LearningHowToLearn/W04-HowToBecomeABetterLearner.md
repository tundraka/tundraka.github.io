#Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential - Part I

##How to become a better learner
Two main tips for how to learn better.
- Exercise
- Practice, brain preparedness.

###Exercise
- New neurons are created in the hippocampus, help learn new things
- New neurons will die if not used. 
- Help new neurons to survive, by having new experiences
 - Learn a new skill. Like fix the plumbing in your sink.
 - Explore a little bit by trying a new route to get to work.
- Exercise help neurons survive
- Better than any drug in the market to help you learn better.
- Benefits the whole body, not just the brain.

###Practice making perfect, but only when the brain is prepared.
- there are certain critical periods in the development of the brain when
  sudden improvements occur in specific abilities, expect them to happen and
  prepare you brain for them.
- Critical period for language acquisition extends up to puberty.
- Binocular depth perception or stereopsis matures during the first 2 years of
  life.
  - If the eyes are not perfectly align, the neurons in your visual cortex
    will fail to properly strengthen the inputs from the two eyes and depth
    perception is permanenty impaired.
- Practice can repair, as well as train the brain. But this takes much longer
  past the critical period.

###Zombies
- Learning, planning, language are the skills that makes us human. This skills
  are primarily controlled by the front of the brain cortex
- the prefrontal cortex is also involved in complex analysis in social
  behaviors
- Last part of the cortex to mature, until it happens, there's probably
  a little bit of zombie.

- Learning is too important to left behind in the classroom.
- Learning to learn is a skill and we can use it to improve every part of our
  life.

##Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
- Learning using metaphor and analogy
- Work profitably with teammates
- Perform well on test.

- Learning doesn't progress logically
- Sometimes we hit a wall.
- Things that we understood previously seem confusing.
- This knowledge collapse seems to occur when the mind is restructuring its
  understanding, building a more solid foundation.
- Means that our mind is wrestling deeply with the material
- Once done, our knowledge will take a leap forward.
- It takes time to assimilate new knowledge.

##Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy
Analogies and metaphors help you remember and understand concepts. The more
visual the better. It's a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to
another.

It's helpful to pretend that you are the concept to understand like putting
yourself in the traveling man problem, or the data analysis data technique that
you're learning.

###Analogies
- Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical
  understanding of the central idea behind the process of concept you are
trying to understand
- Analogies and metaphors are useful for getting people out of einstellung
 - Einstellung: Being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.
###Metaphors
- Metaphors help glue an idea into the mind, because they make a connection to
  neural structures that are already there.
 - Like tracing a pattern using tracking paper.
- Metaphors help you get a sense of what's going on

##No Need for Genius Envy - The imposter syndrome
if you use a procedure a lot, by doing many different types of problems,
you'll see that you understand the how and the why far better than getting
a conventional explanation from a teacher or a book. This greater understanding
comes from the fact that our mind constructed patterns of meaning, rather than
accepting what someone else told you.

People learn by making sense out of the information they've received. People
rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else telling them how it
works.

Experts make many complex decisions by shutting down they conscious and
relaying on their well trained intuition, using their well ingrained chunks.

*this is not clear* I think this is related to 2nd guessing?

At some point self-consciously understanding why you do what you do, just slows
you down and interrupts the process resulting in worse decisions.

Intelligence matters, being smarter often equates to having a larger working
memory. Maybe you can hold 9 items in working memory, and maybe be able to
assimilate those items easier. However, this also makes it more difficult to be
creative. Einstellung, the understanding that we have in mind can block us from
fresh thoughts.

Not being able to hold many items in your working memory means you can more
easily generalize your learning into new, more creative combinations. Because
your working memory which grows from the focusing abilities of the prefrontal
cortex, doesn't lock everything so tightly you can more easily get input from
other areas of the brain which include the sensory cortex which also is more in
tune with what's going on in the environment, but also the source of
dreams/creative ideas. This will require to work more harder, but once the
chunk is created we can take it and use it in creative ways.

Whether you're naturally gifted or you have to struggle to get a solid grasp of the
fundamentals,you should realize that you're not alone if you think you're an
imposter. This is named the *imposter syndrom* feelings of inadequacy.

##Change your Thoughts, Change Your Life
- Santiago Ramon y Cajal.

Myelin sheaths (fatty insulation that helps signals move more quickly along
a neuron) don't finish developing in some people until they're in their 20s.
This may explain why teenager often have problems controlling their impulsive
behavior. The wiring between the intention and the control areas of the brain
isn't completely form.

When you use neural circuits, it seems that you help build the myelin sheath
over them, plus other microscopic changes. Practice appears to strengthen and
reinforce connections between different brain regions, creating highways
between the brain's controls centers, and the centers that store knowledge.

It seems that people can enhance the development of their neuronal circuits by
***practicing thoughts*** that use those neurons. We can make significant
changes in our brain by changing how we think.

> Although brilliant people can do exceptional work just like anyone else they
> can also be careless and biased. - Santiago Ramon y Cajal

Santiago Ramon y Cajal felt that the key for hist success was his perseverance,
which he called *The virtue of the less brilliant*, coupled with his flexible
ability to change his mind and admit errors.

Anyone, even people with average intelligence can change their own brains that
even the least gifted can produce an abundant harvest.

Taking responsibility for your own learning is one of the most important things
you can do.

Santiago Ramon y Cajal warned fellow learners that there will always be those
who criticize or attempt to undermine any effort or achievement you make. This
happens to everybody, if you do well in your studies, people may feel
threatened, the more your achievements the more other people will attack or
demean your efforts. If you fail a test you may also encounter critics that may
say that you don't have what it takes.

We're often told that empathy is universally beneficial, but **it's not. It's
important to learn to switch on an occasional cool dispassion that helps you to
not only focus on what you're trying to learn, but also to tune people out if
you discover their interest lie in undercutting you, such undercutting is all
too common as people are just as competitive as they are cooperative.

When you're a young person, mastering such dispassion can be difficult, we're
naturally excited about what we're working on, and we like to believe that
everyone can be reasoned with and that almost everyone is naturally good
hearted towards us.

Like Santiago Ramon y Cajal, you can take pride in aiming for success because
of the very things that make other people say you can't do it. Take pride in
who you are. Especially in the qualities that make you different and use them
as a secret talisman for success. Use your natural contrariness to defy the
always present prejudices from others about what you can accomplish.

##The value of teamwork, avoiding overconfidence
- Broad-perspective perceptual disorder of the right hemisphere. If they make
  a mistake in their calculations in a non sensical way, there's no way for
them to detect that error. No big picture click that says that the answer
doesn't make any sense.
- The right hemisphere helps us step back and to put our work into big picture
  perspective.
- People with damage to the right hemisphere are often unable to gain ah-ha
  moments.
- The right hemisphere is importan into getting in the right track and doing
  reality checks.
- Subtle avoidance of some of our capabilities can have a surprisingly negative
  impact on our work.
- When we finish an assignment and we don't go back to check our work, we are
  acting *like a person who's refusing to use part of their brain*.
- The right hemisphere servers a a sort of devil's advocate to question the
  status quo and look for global inconsistencies.
- The left  hemisphere on the other hand tends to cling to the way things were.
- The left hemisphere interprets the work for us and will try to keep those
  interpretations unchanged.
- The left centered focus mode has associated with a desire to cling to
  whatever you've done.
- That's the problem with the focus, sometimes a bit left hemisphere leaning
  more of analysis. It provides for an analytical and upbeat approach.
 - Abundant research evidence that suggest that there's a potential for
   *rigidity, dogmatism and egocentricity*.
- Finishing an assigment and feeling that it's correct without a review, may be
  caused by and *overly confident perspective* arising in part from the left
hemisphere.
 - Steping back and recheck, you're allowing for more interaction between the
   2 hemispheres

###Teamwork
- One way to catch your blind spots is to brainstorm and work with others who
  are also smartyl focused on the topic.
- Your naively upbeat focused mode can still skip right over errors. Specially
  if I'm the one who made the errors.
- Even worse is to believe that you have everything nailed down intellectuallt
  but you haven't.
- Study groups can help you catch when you thinking was gone wrong.
- Study group can work as a large scale diffuse mode outside our brain, that
  catches what we missed or were unable to see.
- Explaining to other helps build your understanding.
- Study session can go wrong if the group doesn't focus or is not in the same
  level of interest.

##A test checklist
- Testing has a way of concentrating the mind, 1 hr taking a test helps retain
  more knowledge that 1hr of study.
- Originally developed for engineering by Richard Felder.

1. Did you make a serious effort to understand the text?
2. Did you work with classmates on homework problems? Or check solutions with
   others?
3. Did you attempt to outline every homework problem solution before working
   with classmates?
4. Did you participate actively in homework group discussions, contributing
   ideas and asking questions?
5. Did you consult with the instructor when you were having trouble with
   something?
6. Did you understand all of your homeworks solution when they were handed in?
7. Did you ask in class for explanations of homework problem solutions that
   weren't clear to you?
8. A study guide? Did you carefully go through it before the test and convince
   yourself that you can do everything on it?
9. Did you attempt to outline lots of problem soluton quickly without spending
   time on the algebra in calculations?
10. Did you go over the study guide and problems with classmates and quiz one
    another?
11. If there was a review session before the test, did you attend to it and ask
    questions about anything you weren't sure about?
12. Did you get a reasonable night sleep before the test? If you answer *no*
    the answers to all the preceding questions may not matter.

In the same way pilots or surgeons go over a checklist, going over the test
checklist (answering yes to most of the questions) can vastly improve your
changes of success.

##The hard start - jump to easy technique
- It's common to recommend student, when taking a test, to tackle the easy
  questions first; the idea behind that is that once the easy ones are solved
  you are confident in handling the difficult ones.
 - For some people this may be counter productive.
- Hard problems means that they'll need a lot of time, indicating that you may
  want to start on them first thing on the test.
- Difficult problem may also need for the creative powers of the diffuse mode.
 - But to access the difuse mode, you need to not actively focus on what you're
   trying to solve.
- Easy or hard first?
- Start with the hard ones, but quickly jump to the easy ones.
- When the test is handed, take a quick lool to see what it involves.
- When start working the problems start with what appears to be the hardest
  problem.
 - Pull yourself away within the first minute or two, if you get stuck or sense
   that you might not be in the right track
 - This is helpful because loads the problem in mind and seitches attention
   away from it, allowing the diffuse mode to begin its work.
- When you return to the more difficult problem you'll be pleased that the next
  step seems to be more obvious.
 - You may not be able to go all the way through to the end, but you got
   further before you switch.
- The *hard start-jump to easy* technique may make more efficient use of your
  brain by allowing different parts of the brain to work simultanously on
  different thoughts.
- This technique guarantees that you'll have a little work on each problem. 
- Useful technique to avoid Einstellung, getting stuck on the wrong approach
  because you have a chance to look a the problem from different perspectives.
- You must have the discipline to move away from the difficult problem.
 - This may be why test takers sometimes find that the solution pops up right
   as they walk out the door.
 - When they gave up, their attention switch, allowing the diffuse mode the
   traction it needed to work the solution.
- If you haven't prepared for a test, you might as well try to get as much
  points as you can.

##Final helpful hints for tests
