#Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential

##How to become a better learner
Two main tips for how to learn better.
- Exercise
- Practice, brain preparedness.

###Exercise
- New neurons are created in the hippocampus, help learn new things
- New neurons will die if not used. 
- Help new neurons to survive, by having new experiences
- Exercise help neurons survive
- Better than any drug in the market to help you learn better.
- Benefits the whole body, not just the brain.

###Practice making perfect, but only when the brain is prepared.
- there are certain critical periods in the development of the brain when
  sudden improvements occur in specific abilities, expect them to happen and
  prepare you brain for them.
- Critical period for language acquisition extends up to puberty.
- Binocular depth perception or stereopsis matures during the first 2 years of
  life.
  - If the eyes are not perfectly align, the neurons in your visual cortex
    will fail to properly strengthen the inputs from the two eyes and depth
    perception is permanenty impaired.
- Practice can repair, as well as train the brain. But this takes much longer
  past the critical period.

###Zombies
- Learning, planning, language are the skills that makes us human. This skills
  are primarily controlled by the front of the brain cortex
- the prefrontal cortex is also involved in complex analysis in social
  behaviors
- Last part of the cortex to mature, until it happens, there's probably
  a little bit of zombie.

- Learning is too important to left behind in the classroom.
- Learning to learn is a skill and we can use it to improve every part of our
  life.

##Introduction to Renaissance Learning and Unlocking Your Potential
- Learning using metaphor and analogy
- Work profitably with teammates
- Perform well on test.

- Learning doesn't progress logically
- Sometimes we hit a wall.
- Things that we understood previously seem confusing.
- This knowledge collapse seems to occur when the mind is restructuring its
  understanding, building a more solid foundation.
- Means that our mind is wrestling deeply with the material
- Once done, our knowledge will take a leap forward.
- It takes time to assimilate new knowledge.

##Create a Lively Visual Metaphor or Analogy
Analogies and metaphors help you remember and understand concepts. The more
visual the better. It's a way of realizing that one thing is somehow similar to
another.

It's helpful to pretend that you are the concept to understand like putting
yourself in the traveling man problem, or the data analysis data technique that
you're learning.

###Analogies
- Metaphors and models are often vitally important in giving a physical
  understanding of the central idea behind the process of concept you are
trying to understand
- Analogies and metaphors are useful for getting people out of einstellung
 - Einstellung: Being blocked by thinking about a problem in the wrong way.
###Metaphors
- Metaphors help glue an idea into the mind, because they make a connection to
  neural structures that are already there.
 - Like tracing a pattern using tracking paper.
- Metaphors help you get a sense of what's going on

##No Need for Genius Envy - The importer syndrome

People learn by making sense out of the information they've received. People
rarely learn anything complex simply by having someone else telling them how it
works.

Experts make many complex decisions by shutting down they conscious and
relaying on their well trained intuition, using their well ingrained chunks.
