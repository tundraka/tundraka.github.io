#Introduction
Statistical inference: Go beyond the data, trying to generate new knowledge.
Trying to go beyond our data to a population to get answers. It's the only
formal inference system that we have.

> The process of generating conclusions about a population from a noisy sample.

With statistical inference, the estimators have actual things that they're
estimating. (What are estimators?)

Many different modes of statistical inference.
- bayesians
- frequentists

Frequency style thinking: think of probability like how we think of gambling.
The idea that we can repeat an experiment over and over and the percentage of
times that something happens defines that population parameter.

- Causation
- Association

#Probability
Given a random experiment (rolling a die) a probability measure is a population
quantity that summarizes the randomness
- random experiment: ?
- P = pq summarizes R
 - P = Probabiliyy measure
 - pq = population quantity
 - R = randomness

In the case of the rolling die experiment: population is an intrinsic property of
the die, not of something that is a function of a simple set of fixed rolls of
the die.

- Intrinsic: of or relating to the essential nature of a thing, inherent.

When we talk about probability is not something that is in the data that we have,
but as a conceptual thing that exists in the population that we would like to
estimate.

**Probability calculus**: rules that probability has to follow.

Probability operates on the potential outcomes from an experiment. For
example:
- When you roll a die you could get a 1.
- Or the result can be in the set {1, 2}
- Or the roll was an even/odd number
- etc.

Probability is a function that takes any of these sets of possible outcomes and
assigns it a number between 0 and 1.

We have to have the rule that the probability that something occurs, you roll
the die and you get a number, must be 1.

The probability of the union of any two sets of outcomes that have nothing in
common (mutually exclusive) is the sum of their respective probabilities.

For example one possible outcome is that we get A={1, 2} and another outcome is
that we get B={3, 4} those two outcomes are mutually exclusive, they cannot
simultaneously occur. The probability of the union, that I get the outcome of A
or B is the sum of the probability of the A outcome plus the probability of the
B outcome `P(AUB) = P(A) + P(B)`.

These simple rules are all that is necessary to generalize to all the rules
that we think that probability should follow. Discovered by the Russian
mathematician Kolmogorov.

####Rules probability must follow
- The probability that nothing occurs is 0
- The probability that something occurs is 1
- The probability of something is 1 minus the probability that the opposite
  occurs. In the context of the die, the probability of getting an even number
  is 1 minus the porbability of getting an odd number.
- The probability of at lest one of two (or more) things that are mutually
  exclusive is the sum of their respective probabilities
- If an event A implies the occurrence of event B, then the probability of
  A occurring is less than the probability that B occurs. We can think of
  A being a subset of B.
- For any two events the probability that at least one occurs is the sum of
  their probabilities minus their intersection.
